A simple, developer-friendly WordPress plugin with minimum bloat that lets visitors know that the site is using cookies.

== Description ==

There are many WordPress plugins out there which does a lot of fancy things with the cookie consent. We didn't find one we really liked that was really lightweight and developer friendly and so we created our own.

It isn't meant for the masses who want tons of configurable options in the admin (although it will work fine out of the box). For the developer who wants the functionality and being able to convenietly override the styles in the theme without bloat—here's a plugin for you.

See the installation section for more information on how to install. The FAQ section has important information on how to customize the plugin.

= Translations =

Included in the package are translations for the following languages:

- Swedish
- German
- Norwegian (Thanks Kristofer)

A complete *.pot* file is available in the *translations/* directory. If you use and translate this little plugin, please send us the translation so it can be included!

== Installation ==

We recommend using the built-in plugin installer in WordPress. If you wish to install the plugin manually:

1. Upload `ilmenite-cookie-consent` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Insert a link to your cookie policy in the 'Settings > Reading' page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set the cookie policy link? =
A settings field is appended to the Settings > Reading screen where you can insert a link to the privacy and cookie policy page.

= Can I disable the default stylesheet? =

Out of the box, the plugin includes a lightweight stylesheet. We suggest you implement it in your theme however. To prevent this plugin from loading its own stylesheet, just set the following constant in your wp-config file:

    // Don't load 'Ilmenite Cookie Consent' stylesheets
    define( 'ILCC_DEV_MODE', true );

Note: The constant needs to be defined before the plugin runs.

= Can I change the text? =
Yes of course. To change the main text in the banner, there is a filter available 'ilcc_consent_text'.
To modify the accept button, the filter 'ilcc_accept_text' is also available.
